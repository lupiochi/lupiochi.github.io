This was the first website I've built. I did my best to comply with performance and good practices I found online, and am quite proud of what I managed to design in a few days.  
However, I had a lot of help by: <br>
- Building over a base template by [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) (this one's called Stellar); and <br>
- Drawing inspiration from different websites, such as [Rand Asswad's](rand-asswad.xyz) and [AJPreto's](ajpreto.github.io).
